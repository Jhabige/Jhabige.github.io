## My Story

I graduated from high school in 1999 and went to Kansas State University.  I didn't really have a plan post graduation, but knew that I wasn't too interested in taking over the farm. So I majored in Math.  In my senior year I thought a minor in statistics might complement my math degree, so I reached out to Professor Jim Higgins in the Statistics Department.  He explained that I could even get a Master's degree.  At the time, I honestly wasn't too interested in statistics or math, but I did enjoy the college lifestyle.  Once he explained teaching assistantships to me, I was sold!  I now had a plan to put off having a plan for 2 more years.  In my second year of graduate school everything changed. I absolutely fell in love with research and teaching and have been doing it ever since. After 15 years as a professor of statistics at OSU, I still love research and teaching as much as ever.  But I think what brings me the most joy . . . helping students discover their passion for research.               

## Personal

I'm a sports fan! I love playing tennis (or any racket sport) and discgolf, and watch a lot of college basketball and football. I like to hack at the guitar, sing loudly and poorly, and play piano. I also fell in love with my wife in my second year of graduate school. We have a wonderful 10 year old son.  I have a snuggly cat named Marvin and some other pets too.
