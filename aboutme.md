## My Story

I graduated from high school in 1999 and went to Kansas State University.  I didn't really have a plan post graduation, but knew that I wasn't too interested in taking over the farm. So I majored in Math.  In my senior year I thought a minor in statistics might complement my math degree, so I reached out to Professor Jim Higgins in the Statistics Department.  He explained that I could even get a Master's degree.  At the time, I wasn't really too interested in statistics or math, but I did enjoy the college lifestyle.  Once he explained assistantship to me (free tuition and a salary) I was sold!  I now had a plan to put off having a plan for 2 more years.  In my second year of graduate school I absolutely fell in love with research and teaching, and I've been doing it ever since. 

## Hobbies

I'm a sports fan! Though I'm too old to play competative basketball these days, I still love playing tennis (or any racket sport) and discgolf. I like to hack at the guitar, sing loudly and poorly, and play piano decently. 

## Family
I also fell in love with my wife in my second year of graduate school (what a year). We have a wonderful 10 year old son.  I have a cat named Marvin - and we have some other pets.
